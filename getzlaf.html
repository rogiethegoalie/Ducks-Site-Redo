    <h1 id="news-head">Former Ducks Captain Getzlaf Joins NHL Department of Player Safety</h1>

        alt="Ryan Getzlaf Named to NHL Player of Player Safety">

    <p id="news-p">Former Ducks captain has joined the National Hockey Leagueâ€™s Department of Player Safety, NHL Senior
        Vice President Player Safety George Parros announced Wednesday.</p>

    <br>

    <p id="news-p">"We are thrilled to welcome Ryan as the newest member of our department," Parros said. "His
        accomplishments on the ice speak for themselves: he won at every level and was widely respected for being a
        hard-nosed and highly-skilled Player and effective leader. From his rookie NHL season in 2005 until his recent
        retirement, he lived and played through many of the changes our game has seen, which will provide our group with
        unique and valuable perspective moving forward."</p>

    <br>

    <p id="news-p">Selected by Anaheim in the first round (19th overall) of the 2003 NHL Draft, Getzlaf spent his entire
        career with the Ducks, setting franchise records for career seasons (17), games (1,157), assists (737) and
        points (1,019), among many others. He helped the Ducks capture the Stanley Cup in 2006-07 and was the
        longest-serving captain in Anaheim history (12 seasons, 2010-22).</p>

    <br>

    <p id="news-p">He retired following the 2021-22 season as Anaheim's all-time leading scorer in both the regular
        season and Stanley Cup Playoffs, and is one of 12 players in League history to have captained the same team for
        10 years and have scored 1,000 points.</p>

    <br>

    <p id="news-p">Since June 2023 Getzlaf has served as Player Development Coordinator for the Ducks, assisting
        Director of Player Development Jim Johnson in preparing and educating Anaheim's prospects ahead of their
        professional careers.</p>

    <br>

    <p id="news-p">His longstanding philanthropic efforts in the Orange County community include support for
        CureDuchenne, committed to saving lives of children affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The upcoming 13th
        annual Getzlaf Golf Shootout brings together professional athletes, celebrities, and community leaders in
        support of CureDuchenne. Over the 13 years the tournament has benefited CureDuchenne, Ryan and wife Paige have
        raised more than $5.8 million to fund research to save the lives of those with Duchenne.</p>

    <br>

    <p id="news-p">A native of Regina, Sask. Getzlaf represented Canada at nine international tournaments in a span of
        14 years (2002-16), helping his country to five gold medals, including the 2010 and 2014 Olympic Winter Games,
        2016 World Cup of Hockey, 2005 World Junior Championship and 2003 U-18 World Championship.</p>
