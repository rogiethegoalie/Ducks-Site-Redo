### A staff directory with a list of coaches and training staff.

A short list of the team's  staff to provide the user information on the main members of staff. These have been divided into three main categories: coaching staff, training staff, and equipment staff.
There is also a section dedicated to the team's backroom staff section. Both ownership and hockey operations have also been given individual sections.

![staff page](https://github.com/paddyhockey1/Final-Project/assets/170856162/e767bd9d-4629-44ac-b038-bbb166dc284b)

### Internal links for members of coaching staff.

For the coaching team, I have included seperate internal links to custom pages that contain an image, information and a biographical paragraph. I have created these pages for six members of the coaching staff.

#### Greg Cronin Biography Page
![bio example](https://github.com/paddyhockey1/Final-Project/assets/170856162/2cb5e10b-55b8-431e-83d2-d2401f30a8dd)

### Standings for both the NHL Western Conference and NHL Pacific Division.

#### Pacific Division
The standings page will provide the user with the final standings for the Facific Divison. The Pacific Division Standings page also includes a small icon of the team's logo along with their rank within the division. These standings will include a brief statistical breakdown for each team withinn the division including: games played, wins, losses, overtime losses, and points. There are further statistics for both goals for and goals against in desktop and tablet. These statistics have had to be removed from mobile for space saving reasons

![pacific division](https://github.com/paddyhockey1/Final-Project/assets/170856162/89b0e80a-70de-410d-8e34-faafa04e861e)

#### Western Conference

The page also contains the same statistical breakdown for the wider Western Conference. Team rankings and logos have also been included for clarity. As this includes both the Pacific and Central Divisons it will give the user a greater idea og how Pacific Divsion teams, including the Ducks, fared within the entire conference.

![western conference](https://github.com/paddyhockey1/Final-Project/assets/170856162/c64e774f-cd72-4b0d-bc91-01e91df24407)

### Future Features

* I would like to include a history page. This would detail the team's entire history from 1993. It would also include some of the team's greatest players and statistical breakdowns of past seasons.

* A more detailed roster page with internal links for each member of the roster. This would include statistics and a brief biography along with transaction history and contract information.

* A gallery of games and team events. This could inlude images form games along with fan events and the team's charitable endeavours. Video could be added for game hightlights and post-game interviews. 

* The inclusion of a contact page would allow more interaction with the user. Should the user wish to make contact, a variety of contact options would be available to them to make contact.

* A page with more information of the team's home arena. This would include ticket information, a map of the arena, a guide to local hotels and atractions, and local transport links. There could also be an option for n external link to the Honda Center website. 

* A page that would allow visitors of the page to interact with each other. A forum or message board would provide this option.

#### Lighthouse

* I ran my code through Lighthouse but my SEO score was lower than anticipated. I was informed by my mentor that some Chrome extensions like Adblockers may affect this score. I ran it through Lighthouse again in incognito mode and got a higher score.

![lighthouse-result](https://github.com/paddyhockey1/Final-Project/assets/170856162/5e92d8ea-a316-4cb4-8587-68c0c955f167)

* Performance was excellent. It suggested that I re-size my hero image but when I attempted that the image became less clear and gave the page a poor aesthetic look.

* Accessibility was very good with a single recommendation that I cheading elements are not in sequential order.

* Best practices found no problems with my code.

* SEO issue was that I was using uncrawlable links for my hamburger icon in the mobile top navigation menu. 

#### Bugs

* I was informed by two seperate people that the Facebook link in the footer would not work properly and opened into an error message. Those who tested with iOS did not have this problem.

* Experienced an issue where hero image would not appear ion certain browsers when trying to inspect code. This was resolved when I re-wrote background shorthand code in css.

  #### Unfixed Bugs
  
* The main image on the hero section changes vertically when switched to mobile screen resolution.

## Credits

* I would like to thank both my facilitator and my mentor for their help in helping me create both my project and README. I would also like to thank the various classmates who have helped in a variety of ways.

  ### Media

* I used a large amount of images as I required images for each individual player, coach and team logo. I believe that individual images for each of these elements have helped enhance the user experience.
